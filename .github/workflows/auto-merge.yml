      # Required checks are defined in branch protection rules and include:
      # - Lint: Code quality and formatting checks
      # - Format Check: Go formatting validation
      # - Security: Security scanning (gosec, trivy)
      # - Test (Run on Ubuntu): Core test suite
      # - codecov/patch: New code coverage threshold
      # - codecov/project: Overall project coverage threshold
      #
      # Note: If required checks change in branch protection, update the check-regexp pattern below.

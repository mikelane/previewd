# Previewd - Quick Start for Mike

**TL;DR:** All documentation is ready. You're set to build an AI-powered Kubernetes operator that will be a killer resume project.

## What You Have

✅ **Complete Documentation Package:**
- `README.md` - Project overview, vision, and quick demo
- `CLAUDE.md` - Perfect context for future Claude sessions (most important!)
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Deep technical design and component breakdown
- `ROADMAP.md` - 12-week development timeline with milestones
- `GETTING_STARTED.md` - Step-by-step development setup guide
- `LICENSE` - MIT License
- `.gitignore` - Comprehensive ignore rules

## The Strategic Play

### Why Previewd?

**Resume multiplier effect:**
- ✅ Python expert (dioxide, valid8r)
- ✅ Rust proficiency (dioxide with PyO3)
- ✅ TypeScript (second language)
- 🎯 **Add Go + K8s operators** ← Previewd
- 🎯 **Add AI/infrastructure integration** ← Previewd

**Career unlocks:**
- Staff+ platform engineering roles
- Speaking at KubeCon/meetups
- Consulting at $200-400/hr
- "Built AI-powered K8s operator used by X companies"

### What You're Building

**Previewd** = AI-powered Kubernetes operator that automatically creates preview environments for pull requests.

**The magic:**
1. Developer opens PR
2. AI analyzes code → determines which services needed
3. Operator spins up minimal environment (not all 20 services, just 2)
4. AI generates realistic test data
5. Runs integration tests automatically
6. Posts URL to PR: `https://pr-1234.preview.myapp.com`
7. Auto-destroys when PR merged → $0/day

**Impact:**
- ⚡ 2 minutes vs 30 minutes manual setup
- 💰 70% cost reduction through smart sizing
- 🎯 Realistic test data catches bugs

## Timeline

**12 weeks to v0.2.0 (AI-powered):**
- Weeks 1-2: Learn Go basics
- Weeks 3-6: Build operator (no AI) → v0.1.0
- Weeks 7-10: Add AI features → v0.2.0
- Weeks 11-12: Polish and launch

**Target launch:** February 2026

## Next Steps

### Right Now:

```bash
cd ~/dev/previewd

# Read these files in order:
# 1. README.md (10 min) - Get excited about the vision
# 2. GETTING_STARTED.md (15 min) - Understand setup steps
# 3. ROADMAP.md (10 min) - See the 12-week plan
# 4. CLAUDE.md (20 min) - Complete context for future sessions

# When ready to start:
# Week 1: Complete "A Tour of Go" (https://tour.golang.org/)
# Week 2: Install Kubebuilder and scaffold operator
```

### Important Files to Read

**Start here:**
1. **README.md** - The vision and what you're building
2. **GETTING_STARTED.md** - How to set up your dev environment

**When you start coding:**
3. **ARCHITECTURE.md** - Technical design (reference this when building)
4. **ROADMAP.md** - Week-by-week plan

**For Claude:**
5. **CLAUDE.md** - Most important! Give Claude perfect context every session

## Key Principles

1. **Ship early, iterate fast** - v0.1.0 in 6 weeks (no AI), add AI in v0.2.0
2. **TDD always** - Write tests first, watch fail, make pass
3. **AI for value, not hype** - Only add AI if it measurably helps
4. **Documentation is code** - Keep docs updated with features
5. **Build in public** - Blog posts, videos, community engagement

## Success Looks Like

**By February 2026:**
- ✅ v0.2.0 released with AI features
- ✅ 100 GitHub stars
- ✅ 5 companies testing it
- ✅ Blog post with >1000 views
- ✅ Recruiters reaching out for Staff+ roles

**By June 2026:**
- ✅ 500 GitHub stars
- ✅ Speaking at K8s meetup
- ✅ 10+ production users
- ✅ Consulting opportunities

## What Makes This Different

### Not Just Another K8s Operator

**AI Integration:**
- Analyzes code diffs to detect dependencies (smarter than static config)
- Generates realistic test data (not just dummy data)
- Predicts lifespan and optimizes costs (FinOps + AI)

**Developer Experience:**
- 2 minutes from PR to ready (not 30 minutes)
- Realistic test data catches real bugs
- Auto-cleanup (no manual work)

**Resume Impact:**
- Multi-language (Go + Python for AI)
- Hot topics (K8s + AI + FinOps)
- Real users, real metrics
- Unique (very few AI-powered operators exist)

## Your Competitive Advantage

**You already have:**
- MS in CS with AI/ML emphasis ✅
- Principal Engineer + Dev Lead at GDIT ✅
- Proven framework builder (dioxide, valid8r) ✅
- Testing expertise (pytest plugins) ✅
- AWS/CDK knowledge ✅

**Previewd adds:**
- Go proficiency
- K8s operator mastery
- AI/infrastructure integration
- Platform engineering credibility

**= Perfect Staff+ platform engineer profile**

## Questions?

Everything is documented. Start with:
1. README.md - Get excited
2. GETTING_STARTED.md - Set up environment
3. Week 1 of ROADMAP.md - Begin learning Go

## The Path Forward

### Phase 0 (Weeks 1-2): Learn Go
- Complete "A Tour of Go"
- Build simple CLI tools
- Get comfortable with Go idioms

### Phase 1 (Weeks 3-6): Build Operator
- Scaffold with Kubebuilder
- GitHub webhook integration
- ArgoCD deployment
- **Ship v0.1.0 (no AI yet)**

### Phase 2 (Weeks 7-10): Add AI
- Code analysis
- Synthetic data generation
- Cost optimization
- **Ship v0.2.0 (AI-powered)**

### Phase 3 (Weeks 11-12): Launch
- Blog post
- Demo video

## Remember

- **This is strategic** - Not just a side project, but a career accelerator
- **Claude has context** - CLAUDE.md gives future Claude sessions everything
- **You're not alone** - Comprehensive docs, roadmap, and community
- **Ship early** - v0.1.0 in 6 weeks, not 6 months
